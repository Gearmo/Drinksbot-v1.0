What Is Drinksbot?

Drinksbot is a bot command for Twitch.tv -- it can be used with bots such as NightBot or StreamElements. Upon typing "!drink" in chat, the bot pulls from a txt file with roughly
8192 possible drinks for the user to enjoy. The .txt file is an export of the script, which first identifies rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, or legendary), and then 
creates a unique drink from that rarity pool. Each drink rarity is defined by the number of emojis attached to the drink, 1 being common, 2 being uncommon, and so on. The highest rarity, with 5 emojis, contains a single drink -- the Shiny drink. This is a reference to Shiny Pokemon from the mainline Pokemon games, where the odds of finding a single shiny Pokemon are 1 in 8196.
