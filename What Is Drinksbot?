# Drinksbot-v1.0

What is Drinksbot?

Drinksbot is a bot command for Twitch.tv -- it can be used with bots such as NightBot or StreamElements. Upon typing "!drink" in chat, the bot pulls from a txt file with roughly 8192 possible drinks for the user to enjoy. That txt file is an export of this script, which first identifies a rarity (common, uncommon, rare, epic, or legendary), and then creates a unique drink from that rarity pool. Each drink rarity is defined my the number of emoji, 1 being common, 2 being uncommon, and so on. The highest rarity, with 5 emoji, only contains a single drink -- the shiny drink. This is reminiscent of finding a shiny Pokemon in the main line Pokemon games, at least until Generation 6 where the odds were halved.
